# SaveThemBlobs-AppleScript
An AppleScript made for use with Neal's "SaveThemBlobs". Useful if you have multiple devices.

This has been tested on El Capitan. You must have "requests" installed, along with SaveThemBlobs in the correct directory. You will have to edit the AppleScript. Use the AppleScript as a template.

Use at your own risk. This includes any issues you may run into while running this script. Very limited support will be given for this and will be updated if needed.
